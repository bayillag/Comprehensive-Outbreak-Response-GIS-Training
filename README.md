# Comprehensive Outbreak Response & GIS Training

A 120-day, Ethiopia-tailored program equipping veterinary and public-health professionals with end-to-end skills in outbreak investigation, spatial analysis, remote sensing, data-platform workflows, and interactive dashboards.

---

## Training Program Overview

### Part I: Foundational Outbreak Surveillance & Response  

Builds core capabilities in case definitions, line listing, descriptive and analytic epidemiology, statistical methods, and initial situation reporting.

### Part II: Strategy, Review & Reflection  

Guides participants through presenting control plans, peer review of workflows and maps, quality-assurance checklists, and forward-looking action roadmaps.

### Part III: Risk-Based Surveillance  

Covers the principles and evaluation of risk-based systems, early detection survey design, performance metrics, economic valuation, and framework implementation.

### Part IV: GIS for Animal Health Surveillance  

Introduces GIS data models and sources, geoprocessing and cartographic design, spatial analysis techniques, and scripting to automate mapping tasks.

### Part V: Advanced Spatial Analytics  

Delves into exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), clustering methods, risk assessment modeling in QGIS/R, raster-based environmental covariates, and decision-support mapping.

### Part VI: Collaboration & Notebooks  

Focuses on reproducible workflows with Git/GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, and interactive Python notebooks (Colab) for geospatial analyses and extensions.

### Part VII: Exploration & Relational Databases  

Teaches data exploration with Kaggle, notebook sharing best practices, SQL fundamentals, advanced queries (joins, views, CTEs), stored procedures, and performance tuning.

### Part VIII: Spatial Platforms & Backend Services  

Guides setup and use of PostGIS geometry types and spatial queries, raster analyses, QGIS/Python integration, plus Supabase for REST APIs, real-time subscriptions, and secure deployment.

### Part IX: Web Apps & Dashboards  

Covers R Shiny fundamentals, reactive programming, modularization, theming, deployment strategies, and Power BI data modeling, transformation (M/DAX), and dashboard publishing.
