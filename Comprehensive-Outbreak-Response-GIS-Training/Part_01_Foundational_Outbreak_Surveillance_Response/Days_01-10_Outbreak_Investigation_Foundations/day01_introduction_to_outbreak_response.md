# **Day 1 – Introduction to Outbreak Response for Animal Diseases**
  
Bloom Level: Understand | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Define key concepts specific to animal disease events: outbreak, epizootic, enzootic, and panzootic  
- Describe the stages of an animal health outbreak response lifecycle  
- Identify essential stakeholders in animal health emergencies (veterinary authorities, farmers, labs, supply chains)  
- Recognize critical data types for livestock outbreaks: species, herd/flock demographics, clinical signs, and lab confirmations  

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Animal Disease Response Framework (45 min)  
   - Phases: detection, investigation, control, recovery, and evaluation  
   - Role of veterinary services, OIE standards, and national animal health policies  

2. Case Study: Foot‐and‐Mouth Disease in Cattle (30 min)  
   - Timeline of detection to containment  
   - Key control measures: movement restrictions, ring vaccination, biosecurity  

3. Group Exercise: Livestock System Stakeholder Mapping (45 min)  
   - In teams, list actors: smallholder farmers, traders, abattoirs, feed suppliers, regulators  
   - Diagram communication and decision pathways in an animal outbreak  

4. Interactive Demo: Data Triage for Animal Cases (60 min)  
   - Review a mock animal case line list with fields: farm ID, species, case date, signs, test result  
   - Prioritize data elements for immediate action: affected premises, species at risk, movement history  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Challenges: biosecurity enforcement, farmer compliance, sample transport  
   - Strategies for rapid livestock tracing and community engagement  

## Exercise Details  

- Scenario packet includes a synthetic line list of infected premises, farm locations, and preliminary lab confirmations  
- Teams draft a 24‐hour response plan focusing on data flows, tracing protocols, and urgent control steps  
- Present maps or flowcharts illustrating how information moves from field to central veterinary authority  

## Assignment  

Submit to `assignments/day01_animal/` by Day 2 morning:

   - Diagram of animal health actors and their communication/decision‐making roles  

3. **Reflection** (`day01_reflection.md`)  
   - 200 words on which data fields you prioritized for animal cases and why they’re critical for an effective response
