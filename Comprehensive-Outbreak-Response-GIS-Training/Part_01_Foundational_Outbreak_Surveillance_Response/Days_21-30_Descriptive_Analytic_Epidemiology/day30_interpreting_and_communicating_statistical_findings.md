# **Day 30 – Interpreting and Communicating Statistical Findings**  
Bloom Level: Evaluate & Create | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Interpret statistical outputs (p-values, confidence intervals, effect sizes) in the context of animal disease investigations.  
- Translate complex results into clear, actionable insights for diverse audiences.  
- Design compelling visualizations (forest plots, traffic-light tables, dashboards) that highlight key findings.  
- Prepare written summaries and presentations tailored to technical experts and non-technical stakeholders.

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Principles of Interpretation (45 min)  
   - Beyond significance: effect size, uncertainty, and practical relevance  
   - Common pitfalls: over-interpretation, multiple comparisons, and miscommunication  

2. Demo: Storytelling with Data (30 min)  
   - Framing findings for different readers (epidemiologists vs. policy makers)  
   - Examples of before-and-after report excerpts  

3. Group Exercise: Audience-Specific Summaries (45 min)  
   - Teams receive a mock results table of RRs, ORs, and p-values  
   - Draft two 150-word summaries: one technical, one executive brief  

4. Interactive Demo: Building a Visual Dashboard (60 min)  
   - Use R Shiny or Python Dash to create a simple dashboard with key metrics  
   - Incorporate traffic-light color coding and interactive filters  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Strategies for handling uncertainty and conflicting results  
   - Best practices for slide design and live presentations

## Exercise Details  

**Data Provided:**  
- `day30_results_table.csv`: metrics from recent outbreak analyses (RRs, ORs, CIs, p-values)  
- `day30_template_report.md`: skeleton for technical and executive summaries  
- Sample R Shiny app and Python Dash starter code  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. Interpret the provided results table: comment on significance, precision, and implications.  
2. Write two audience-tailored summaries (technical & executive), emphasizing clarity and brevity.  
3. Develop one visualization: either a forest plot in R/Python or a mini-dashboard screenshot.
