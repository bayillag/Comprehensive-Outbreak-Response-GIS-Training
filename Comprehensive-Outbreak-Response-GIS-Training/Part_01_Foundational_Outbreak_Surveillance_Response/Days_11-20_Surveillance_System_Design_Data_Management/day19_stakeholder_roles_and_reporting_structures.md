# **Day 19 – Stakeholder Roles and Reporting Structures for Animal Disease Outbreaks**  

Bloom Level: Analyze | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Identify key stakeholders in animal health emergencies, including veterinary authorities, farmers, laboratories, transporters, and international bodies.  

- Describe the reporting hierarchy and communication channels from field-level case detection to national and international authorities.  

- Analyze the roles, responsibilities, and information needs of each stakeholder group.  

- Design clear reporting protocols, timelines, and feedback loops to ensure timely decision making.  

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Animal Health Stakeholder Ecosystem (45 min)  
   - Overview of stakeholders and their mandates  
   - Reporting obligations under WOAH (OIE) and national veterinary regulations  

2. Case Study: Avian Influenza Response Network (30 min)  
   - Timeline of notifications from farmers to FAO/OIE  
   - Breakdown of information exchanged at each step  

3. Group Exercise: Stakeholder Mapping (45 min)  
   - Teams list stakeholders and define roles, inputs, outputs  
   - Create a stakeholder matrix with communication means and frequency  

4. Interactive Demo: Simulated Reporting Workflow (60 min)  
   - Walk through a mock outbreak scenario  
   - Participants trigger alerts, submit reports, and receive feedback via defined channels  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Challenges in coordination: data timeliness, trust, resource constraints  
   - Strategies to streamline reporting and strengthen feedback loops  

## Exercise Details  

Data Provided:  
- Scenario brief with outbreak timeline (`day19_scenario.pdf`)  
- Template for stakeholder matrix (`stakeholder_matrix.xlsx`)  
- Example notification forms and email templates  

Key Tasks:  
1. Populate the stakeholder matrix with roles, reporting frequency, and communication channels.  
2. Draft a flowchart showing the end-to-end reporting structure, including escalation triggers.  
3. Simulate two reporting events: a field case detection and a lab confirmation, documenting each step.
