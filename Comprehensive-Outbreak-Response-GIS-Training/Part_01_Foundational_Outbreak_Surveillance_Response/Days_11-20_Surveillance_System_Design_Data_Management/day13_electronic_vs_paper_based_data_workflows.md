# **Day 13 – Electronic vs. Paper‐Based Data Workflows**

Bloom Level: Analyze | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Compare the advantages and limitations of paper‐based and electronic data capture in animal health surveillance.  

- Identify common error sources and bottlenecks in both workflows.  

- Design a hybrid data workflow that integrates paper collection with digital entry and synchronization.  

- Develop training and support strategies to ensure accurate field data capture and timely integration.  

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Workflow Paradigms (45 min)  
   - Overview of paper forms, mobile apps, and web‐based entry  
   - Data flow, turnaround times, and resource requirements  

2. Case Study: Pastoral Livestock Outbreak in Remote Areas (30 min)  
   - Paper reporting in low‐connectivity zones  
   - Transition to ODK/KoboToolbox and impact on timeliness  

3. Group Exercise: Mapping End‐to‐End Workflows (45 min)  
   - Teams draft dual flowcharts for purely paper and purely electronic systems  
   - Identify key steps, decision points, and potential data loss  

4. Interactive Demo: Digitizing a Paper Form (60 min)  
   - Scan and OCR‐prepare a livestock case form  
   - Build an equivalent form in KoboToolbox/ODK with validation rules  
   - Simulate field entries and export to CSV  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Hybrid models: scanning, batch entry, real‐time sync  
   - Strategies for training, user support, and contingency planning  

## Exercise Details  

**Data Provided:**  
- Blank paper case report (`day13_paper_form.pdf`)  
- OCR tool instructions and sample scanned images  
- Blank KoboToolbox form skeleton (`day13_form_skeleton.xlsx`)  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. Create side‐by‐side flowcharts (paper vs electronic) highlighting steps, actors, and timing.  
2. Digitize the provided paper form into KoboToolbox, enforcing required fields and skip logic.  
3. Simulate at least five submissions in the mobile app and export the combined dataset.

4. Sample Submission Export (`day13_submissions.csv`)  
5. Reflection (`day13_reflection.md`)  
   - 200 words on workflow trade‐offs, error risks, and recommendations for sustainable implementation.
