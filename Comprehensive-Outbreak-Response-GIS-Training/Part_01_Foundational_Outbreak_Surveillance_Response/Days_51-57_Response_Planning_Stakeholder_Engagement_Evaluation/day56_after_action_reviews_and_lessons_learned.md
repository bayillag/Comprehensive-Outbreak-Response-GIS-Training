# **Day 56 – After-Action Reviews and Lessons Learned**
  
Bloom Level: Evaluate & Create | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Understand the purpose, structure, and value of After-Action Reviews (AARs) in outbreak response.  
- Gather and synthesize quantitative data (timelines, metrics) and qualitative inputs (stakeholder feedback).  
- Facilitate root-cause analysis to identify strengths, gaps, and areas for improvement.  
- Develop clear, actionable recommendations with assigned responsibilities and timelines.

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: AAR Principles (45 min)  
   - Definition and goals of an AAR  
   - Key components: timeline reconstruction, SWOT analysis, root-cause exploration  
   - Roles and participant selection  

2. Demo: Sample AAR Walkthrough (30 min)  
   - Review a completed AAR report structure  
   - Highlight effective recommendations and follow-up tracking  

3. Workshop Part 1 – Timeline & Data Review (45 min)  
   - Load `day56_response_log.csv` and `day56_metrics.xlsx`  
   - Reconstruct incident timeline and overlay key decision points  
   - Identify quantitative performance against targets  

4. Workshop Part 2 – Facilitated Discussion (60 min)  
   - Split into thematic groups (surveillance, logistics, communication)  
   - Use `day56_stakeholder_feedback.csv` and survey notes to capture successes/gaps  
   - Apply “5 Whys” to probe root causes  

5. Synthesis & Next Steps (30 min)  
   - Consolidate group findings into a single table of lessons learned  
   - Draft SMART recommendations and assign leads  
   - Outline a follow-up monitoring plan  

6. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Ensuring recommendations translate into practice  
   - Maintaining institutional memory and continuous improvement

## Exercise Details  

**Data Provided:**  
- `day56_response_log.csv`: timestamped actions and responsible teams  
- `day56_metrics.xlsx`: key performance indicators (e.g., response time, coverage)  
- `day56_stakeholder_feedback.csv`: anonymized feedback from field teams and community reps  
- `aar_template.docx`: structured AAR report template  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. Recreate the outbreak response timeline and annotate major decision points.  
2. Compare performance metrics against targets and highlight variances.  
3. Conduct small-group root-cause analyses on identified gaps.  
4. Synthesize successes and failures into a consolidated “Lessons Learned” table.  
5. Formulate SMART recommendations, assign owners, and propose timelines for implementation.

## Assignment  

Submit to `assignments/day56/` by Day 57 morning:  

1. After-Action Review Report (`day56_AAR_report.docx`)  
   - Executive summary, timeline, SWOT or “Strengths & Gaps” table, root-cause findings, and SMART recommendations.  

2. Lessons Learned Table (`day56_lessons.csv`)  
   - Columns: `theme`, `finding`, `root_cause`, `recommendation`, `owner`, `due_date`.  

3. Presentation Slides (`day56_AAR_slides.pptx`)  
   - 10–12 slides summarizing key lessons, proposed actions, and accountability matrix.  

4. Follow-Up Plan (`day56_followup.md`)  
   - 300 words describing how progress on recommendations will be tracked, reported, and reviewed.  

5. Reflection (`day56_reflection.md`, 200 words)  
   - Reflect on the AAR process, challenges in candid review, and how you’ll apply lessons to future responses.
