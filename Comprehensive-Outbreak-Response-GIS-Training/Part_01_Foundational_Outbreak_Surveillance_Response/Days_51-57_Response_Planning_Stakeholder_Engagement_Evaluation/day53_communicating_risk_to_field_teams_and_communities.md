# **Day 53 – Communicating Risk to Field Teams and Communities**
  
Bloom Level: Create & Evaluate | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Understand core principles of effective risk communication in outbreak settings.  

- Tailor messages and materials for two distinct audiences: technical field teams and lay community members.  

- Leverage visual aids (maps, infographics) and narrative formats (radio scripts, SMS) to convey urgency, guidance, and reassurance.  

- Design participatory feedback loops to assess comprehension and trust.  

- Integrate cultural, linguistic, and literacy considerations into message development.

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Principles of Risk Communication (45 min)  
   - Trust, transparency, empathy, and clarity  
   - Audience segmentation: field teams vs. community groups  
   - Cultural and language adaptation; literacy-level adjustments  
   - Selecting channels: interpersonal, print, broadcast, digital  

2. Demo: Communication Materials Showcase (30 min)  
   - Detailed risk map for technical use  
   - Simplified community map with icons and zones  
   - Infographic and poster examples  
   - SMS templates and radio‐spot scripts  
   - Dashboard snippets and mobile alerts  

3. Lab Part 1 – Developing Audience-Specific Messages (60 min)  
   - Split into two teams: one drafts a technical field briefing, the other crafts a community outreach message  
   - Use `day53_risk_levels.csv` and `day53_case_trends.csv` to inform content  
   - Incorporate visual mock-ups and plain-language text  
   - Peer review for clarity, relevance, and tone  

4. Lab Part 2 – Designing a Communication Campaign (45 min)  
   - Define objectives, key messages, channels, timing, and responsible parties  
   - Build a communication schedule with feedback mechanisms (e.g., hotlines, community meetings)  
   - Map out stakeholder engagement and rumor‐management strategies  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Managing misinformation and community concerns  
   - Monitoring message reach, comprehension, and behavior change  
   - Adapting strategies in rapidly evolving outbreaks

## Exercise Details  

**Data Provided:**  
- `day53_risk_levels.csv`: administrative units with composite risk scores  
- `day53_case_trends.csv`: weekly case counts by location  
- `day53_demographics.csv`: population age, language, literacy rates  
- Templates: `flyer_template.pptx`, `sms_templates.docx`, `radio_script_template.txt`  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. Develop audience profiles and communication needs analysis.  
2. Draft two message sets:  
   - Technical briefing bullets + detailed map legend for field teams.  
   - Plain-language bullet points + iconographic map for community members.  
3. Produce two risk maps:  
   - `map_field.png` with granular data and coordinate grid.  
   - `map_community.png` with clear risk zones, icons, and minimal text.  
4. Create a communication plan outlining objectives, messages, channels, schedule, and feedback loops.
