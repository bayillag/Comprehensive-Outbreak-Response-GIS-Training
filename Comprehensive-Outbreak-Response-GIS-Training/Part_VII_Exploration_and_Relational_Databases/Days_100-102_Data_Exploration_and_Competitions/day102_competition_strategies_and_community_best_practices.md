# **Day 102 – Competition Strategies & Community Best Practices**
  
Bloom Level: Analyze & Evaluate | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Understand the lifecycle of data science competitions: problem framing, evaluation metrics, and submission rules.  

- Analyze top‐performing solutions to identify common modeling, feature engineering, and ensembling strategies.  

- Structure a reproducible competition workflow: data partitioning, validation schemes, and version control.  

- Engage effectively with the community: forum participation, sharing kernels, and adhering to code of conduct.  

- Apply best practices for collaboration, reproducibility, and ethical use of shared resources.

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Competition Fundamentals (45 min)  
   - Competition formats (challenge vs. hackathon) and evaluation metrics (RMSE, log‐loss, F1).  
   - Leaderboard dynamics: public vs. private splits, overfitting risks.  
   - Rules, submissions, and prize structures.  

2. Demo: Exploring the Kaggle Ecosystem (30 min)  
   - Navigating competition pages: Data tab, Kernels, Discussion forums.  
   - Inspecting leaderboards and downloading top‐ranked kernels.  
   - Setting up your private repository and submission pipeline.  

3. Lab Part 1 – Baseline Model Development (60 min)  
   - Load provided sample competition dataset (`day102_competition_sample.csv`).  
   - Define train/validation splits consistent with competition rules.  
   - Implement and evaluate a simple baseline model (e.g., logistic regression or random forest).  

4. Lab Part 2 – Champion Solution Analysis (45 min)  
   - Unzip and review top three solution kernels (`day102_top_solutions.zip`).  
   - Document their feature engineering, preprocessing steps, and ensembling techniques.  
   - Identify at least two ideas to improve upon the baseline.  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Community best practices: respectful forum engagement, sharing code under appropriate licenses.  
   - Reproducibility checklists for kernels and notebooks.  
   - Strategies to avoid blind spots: private leaderboard overfitting and data leakage.

## Exercise Details  

**Data & Resources Provided:**  

| Item                             | Description                                                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| day102_competition_sample.csv    | Sample training and test files with feature columns and target.   |
| day102_leaderboard.csv           | Public and private leaderboard scores for reference.              |
| day102_top_solutions.zip         | Three exported kernels (scripts/notebooks) from winning teams.    |

**Key Tasks:**  

- Register for the sample competition on Kaggle and agree to its rules.  

- Download and inspect `day102_competition_sample.csv`; partition data to mirror leaderboard splits.  

- Code a reproducible baseline model pipeline in Python or R; evaluate performance and record metrics.  

- Review each solution in `day102_top_solutions.zip`: annotate their preprocessing, feature sets, model architectures, and ensembling strategies.  

- Propose two concrete improvements and implement one in your baseline; compare metrics before and after.
