# **Day 115 – Reactive Inputs, Outputs & Events**
  
Bloom Level: Apply & Create | Duration: 4 hrs  

---

## Objectives  

- Explain Shiny’s reactive programming model and dependency graph.  
- Use reactive expressions and reactive values to manage dynamic data flows.  
- Implement event-driven logic with `observe()`, `observeEvent()`, and `eventReactive()`.  
- Control reactivity with `isolate()`, `req()`, and `validate()`.  
- Create interactive features: modal dialogs, notifications, and conditional UI.

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Shiny Reactivity Fundamentals (45 min)  
   - Reactive expressions vs. observers  
   - Dependency tracking, invalidation, and isolation  

2. Demo: Reactive Inputs & Dynamic UI (30 min)  
   - `reactive()`, `reactiveVal()`, `reactiveValues()`  
   - Generating inputs with `renderUI()` and `uiOutput()`  

3. Lab Part 1 – Reactive Data Flows (60 min)  
   - Wrap data filtering and transformations in reactive expressions  
   - Track user interactions with `reactiveVal` counters  
   - Apply `isolate()` to prevent unwanted recomputations  

4. Lab Part 2 – Event Handling & Side Effects (45 min)  
   - Use `eventReactive()` to trigger calculations on button clicks  
   - Respond to input changes with `observeEvent()` for modals and notifications  
   - Implement `modalDialog()` and `showNotification()`  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Debugging reactive chains with `reactlog` and console messages  
   - Performance considerations: avoiding redundant reactives

## Exercise Details  

**Data Provided:**  

| File                     | Description                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| day115_data.csv          | Time-series epidemiological data with category fields  |
| day115_shiny_template.R  | Starter Shiny app skeleton (UI and server placeholders) |
| day115_helpers.R         | Utility functions for notifications and modals      |

**Key Tasks:**  

- Load `day115_data.csv` and create UI controls for variable and date selection.  
- Encapsulate filtering logic in a `reactive()` expression and display via `renderTable()`.  
- Initialize a `reactiveVal()` counter that increments on each action button click; show the count dynamically.  
- Build a dynamic `selectInput()` inside `renderUI()` that updates choices based on filtered data.  
- Use `eventReactive()` to compute summary statistics only when the user clicks “Calculate” and display results with `renderPlot()`.  
- Implement `observeEvent()` to show a `modalDialog()` with row details when a table row is clicked.
