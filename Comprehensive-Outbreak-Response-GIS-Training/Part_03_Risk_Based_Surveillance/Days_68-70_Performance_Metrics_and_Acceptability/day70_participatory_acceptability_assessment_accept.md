# **Day 70 – Participatory Acceptability Assessment (AccEPT)**
  
Bloom Level: Create & Evaluate | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Define acceptability in the context of animal health interventions and surveillance.  
- Introduce the AccEPT framework for participatory assessment of control measures.  
- Design mixed‐methods tools (surveys, focus groups, key‐informant interviews) to gauge community and field‐team perceptions.  
- Integrate qualitative and quantitative data into acceptance metrics and GIS visualizations.  
- Use acceptability insights to refine strategy communication, logistics, and implementation plans.

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Principles of Acceptability & the AccEPT Framework (45 min)  
   - Concepts: uptake, trust, perceived burden, cultural fit  
   - Overview of AccEPT stages: engagement, data collection, analysis, feedback  

2. Case Study & Demo: Participatory Assessment in Action (30 min)  
   - Example from a ring-vaccination campaign  
   - Tools: ODK survey design, QGIS heatmaps of acceptance scores  

3. Lab Part 1 – Instrument Design (60 min)  
   - Draft a structured survey with Likert items on ease, trust, and intent‐to‐comply  
   - Outline FGD and interview guides for community leaders and field teams  
   - Peer‐review for clarity and cultural relevance  

4. Lab Part 2 – Data Integration & Mapping (45 min)  
   - Load sample survey results (`day70_survey_responses.csv`) and coded FGD summaries  
   - Compute acceptance scores by village and demographic group  
   - Create a choropleth or proportional symbol map of acceptability metrics  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Interpreting mixed‐methods findings  
   - Addressing low‐acceptance zones through targeted communication  
   - Incorporating real‐time feedback into operational plans

## Exercise Details  

**Data Provided:**  
- `day70_survey_responses.csv`: de-identified survey answers with village and demographic fields  
- `day70_fgd_summaries.xlsx`: coded themes from focus‐group discussions  
- `day70_admin.shp`: administrative boundaries and population data  
- `day70_demographics.csv`: age, gender, and livelihood profiles by village  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. Develop and refine a survey instrument (.docx) and FGD/interview guide (.md).  
2. Clean and merge response data; calculate mean acceptability scores and standard deviations by village.  
3. Map acceptability: visualize high, medium, and low acceptance zones with appropriate symbology.  
4. Synthesize qualitative themes into acceptance barriers and facilitators.  
5. Propose strategy adjustments (communication channels, training, logistical tweaks) based on findings.
