# **Day 64 – Contextual Drivers of Surveillance Systems**
  
Bloom Level: Analyze & Evaluate | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Explore political, socio-cultural, economic, and environmental drivers influencing surveillance performance.  

- Assess how governance, policy frameworks, infrastructure, and community dynamics shape data flows and uptake.  

- Map stakeholder roles, incentives, and power dynamics across surveillance processes.  

- Integrate contextual drivers into system design, evaluation, and improvement strategies.

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Drivers of Surveillance Performance (45 min)  
   - Governance and policy frameworks  
   - Socio-cultural norms and community engagement  
   - Economic resources and logistical capacities  

2. Case Study: National vs. Community Surveillance (30 min)  
   - Comparing enabling factors and barriers  
   - Lessons from diverse country contexts  

3. Lab Part 1 – Driver Mapping (60 min)  
   - Load political, socio-economic, and performance datasets  
   - Create choropleth and proportional symbol maps  
   - Overlay performance indicators to reveal spatial patterns  

4. Lab Part 2 – Stakeholder Analysis (45 min)  
   - Use stakeholder roles and influence scores  
   - Build an influence-interest matrix and network diagram  
   - Identify leverage points for system strengthening  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Incorporating context into surveillance planning  
   - Balancing top-down policies with grassroots realities

## Exercise Details  

**Data Provided:**  
- day64_political_index.csv: governance and policy scores by region  
- day64_soc_data.shp: demographic and socio-economic layers  
- day64_performance.csv: surveillance metrics (timeliness, completeness)  
- day64_stakeholders.xlsx: stakeholder roles, mandates, and influence levels  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. Normalize and map contextual drivers alongside surveillance performance metrics.  
2. Compute Pearson correlations between selected drivers and system indicators.  
3. Construct a stakeholder influence-interest matrix and corresponding network diagram.  
4. Identify 3–5 key contextual barriers and enablers, and propose targeted system improvements.
