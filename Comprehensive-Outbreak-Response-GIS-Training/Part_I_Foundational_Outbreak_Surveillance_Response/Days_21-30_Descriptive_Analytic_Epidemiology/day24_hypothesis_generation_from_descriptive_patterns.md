# **Day 24 – Hypothesis Generation from Descriptive Patterns**
  
Bloom Level: Analyze & Evaluate | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Identify potential epidemiological hypotheses based on observed animal, place, and time patterns.  

- Translate descriptive outputs (maps, curves, rates) into plausible exposure and transmission scenarios.  

- Prioritize generated hypotheses by biological plausibility, data support, and potential impact on control.  

- Design targeted analyses or field investigations to test and refine top hypotheses.  

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: From Description to Hypothesis (45 min)  
   - Role of descriptive epidemiology in hypothesis generation  
   - Types of hypotheses: source, mode of transmission, risk factors  

2. Case Study: Anthrax in Pastoral Herds (30 min)  
   - Review incidence maps and epidemic curve  
   - Derive candidate hypotheses (e.g., grazing patterns, soil pH, carcass disposal)  

3. Group Exercise: Hypothesis Brainstorming (45 min)  
   - Teams examine provided descriptive outputs  
   - Generate at least five hypotheses explaining outbreak dynamics  

4. Interactive Demo: Linking Patterns to Questions (60 min)  
   - Use QGIS to overlay cases with environmental layers  
   - Identify spatial clusters and formulate related hypotheses  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Criteria for hypothesis prioritization  
   - Balancing feasibility and scientific rigor in follow-up studies

## Exercise Details  

**Data Provided:**  
- `day24_descriptive_outputs.zip` containing case maps, epi-curves, and rate tables  
- Environmental layers: grazing zones, water points, soil type shapefiles  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. Review mapping and temporal outputs to spot unusual patterns.  
2. List five distinct hypotheses on outbreak drivers or spread mechanisms.  
3. Develop a simple prioritization matrix rating each hypothesis on plausibility, data availability, and impact.  
4. Outline an analytical approach or field investigation to test the top‐ranked hypothesis.
