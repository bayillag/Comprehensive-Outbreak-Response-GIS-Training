# **Day 5 – Designing Effective Surveillance Systems**
  
Bloom Level: Apply | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Identify core components of an effective animal disease surveillance system, including data sources, reporting pathways, and feedback loops.  
- Compare passive, active, sentinel, and event-based surveillance approaches for livestock populations.  
- Design a surveillance workflow that integrates field reporting, laboratory confirmation, and data management.  
- Develop standard operating procedures and quality‐assurance measures to ensure data timeliness and accuracy.  

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Surveillance System Architecture (45 min)  
   - Key elements: case detection, data flow, analysis, feedback, and response triggers  
   - Balancing coverage, cost, and program objectives  

2. Case Study: Sentinel Surveillance in Peste des Petits Ruminants (30 min)  
   - Selecting sentinel herds, sampling frequency, and reporting metrics  
   - Evaluating sensitivity and resource implications  

3. Group Exercise: Workflow Mapping (45 min)  
   - In teams, draft a flowchart showing roles and data exchanges from field to central authority  
   - Identify decision points, communication channels, and timetable for routine reporting  

4. Interactive Demo: Configuring a Mobile Reporting Form (60 min)  
   - Use a KoboToolbox template to build a livestock case‐report form  
   - Define mandatory fields, validation rules, and skip logic for clinical signs and lab requests  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Maintaining data quality under field constraints  
   - Strategies for stakeholder engagement and training  

## Exercise Details  

- Data Provided:  
  - Region map with administrative layers (`region_shapefile.zip`)  
  - Blank workflow template (`surveillance_workflow_template.vsdx`)  
  - KoboToolbox form skeleton (`kobo_template.xml`)  

- Key Tasks:  
  1. Select surveillance sites and justify your sampling strategy.  
  2. Draft a detailed workflow diagram showing data flow, responsibilities, and timelines.  
  3. Customize the Kobo form to capture critical data elements and enforce validation rules.  

## Assignment  

Submit to `assignments/day05/` by Day 6 morning:

1. **Surveillance System Design** (`day05_system_design.md`)  
   - 400–500 words describing your proposed system architecture, site selection rationale, and quality‐assurance measures.  

2. **Workflow Diagram** (`day05_workflow.png`)  
   - Flowchart illustrating data capture, reporting pathways, and feedback loops.  

3. **Kobo Form Export** (`day05_kobo_form.xml`)  
   - Completed form ready for deployment, with validation and skip logic.  

4. **Reflection** (`day05_reflection.md`)  
   - 200 words on challenges in balancing sensitivity, cost, and feasibility, plus lessons for future surveillance design.
