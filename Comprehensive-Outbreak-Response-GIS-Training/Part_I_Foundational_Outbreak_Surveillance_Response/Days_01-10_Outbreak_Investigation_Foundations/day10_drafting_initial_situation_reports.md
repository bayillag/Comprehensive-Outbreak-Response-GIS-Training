# **Day 10 – Drafting Initial Situation Reports for Animal Disease Outbreaks**

Bloom Level: Apply | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Draft concise situation reports that summarize key outbreak findings and control actions  
- Structure content for diverse audiences: field teams, policy makers, and donors  
- Integrate epidemiological metrics, maps, and data tables into a coherent narrative  
- Formulate clear, actionable recommendations and identify data gaps

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Anatomy of an Effective Situation Report (45 min)  
   - Core sections: executive summary, epidemiology, control measures, resource needs, and next steps  
   - Tailoring language and detail level for technical vs. non-technical readers  

2. Case Sample Review (30 min)  
   - Critique example reports from foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza responses  
   - Highlight best practices in visuals, clarity, and organization  

3. Group Exercise: Report Outline Drafting (45 min)  
   - Teams receive a mock data package (line list, maps, epi-curves)  
   - Develop a structured outline with headings, bullet points, and data placeholders  

4. Interactive Demo: Assembling the Report (60 min)  
   - Use a Word/Markdown template to insert text, tables (attack rates by zone), and QGIS-exported maps  
   - Apply styling for readability: headings, bullet lists, labeled figures  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Strategies for rapid report production under field constraints  
   - Distribution channels: email briefs, shared drives, stakeholder presentations
