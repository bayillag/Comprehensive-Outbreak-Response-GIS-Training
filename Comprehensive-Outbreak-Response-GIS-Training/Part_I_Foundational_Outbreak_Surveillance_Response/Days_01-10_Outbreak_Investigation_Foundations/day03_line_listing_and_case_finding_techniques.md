# **Day 3 – Line Listing and Case Finding Techniques for Animal Disease Outbreaks**

Bloom Level: Apply | Duration: 4 hrs  

## Objectives  

- Describe the purpose and structure of a line list in outbreak investigations  
- Compare passive, active, and enhanced case finding approaches  
- Design and implement a standardized line list template for animal disease data  
- Apply filtering and validation to ensure completeness and consistency of case records  

## Agenda  

1. Lecture: Line Listing Fundamentals (45 min)  
   - Key fields: unique ID, species, premises location, dates, clinical signs, lab results, outcome  
   - Importance of standardized templates and data validation rules  

2. Case Study: Rift Valley Fever Investigation (30 min)  
   - Review a published line list from an RVF outbreak  
   - Discuss strengths and gaps in case ascertainment  

3. Group Exercise: Template Design (45 min)  
   - In teams, draft a line list schema for a notional livestock outbreak  
   - Define mandatory versus optional fields and data entry constraints  

4. Interactive Demo: Building & Using Line Lists (60 min)  
   - Create and validate a line list in Excel, then import into R/Python  
   - Apply filters to identify duplicates, missing values, and suspect records  
   - Simulate active case finding: integrate community survey data into the master list  

5. Discussion & Q&A (30 min)  
   - Balancing timeliness with data quality in field settings  
   - Strategies to train field teams and maintain data integrity  

## Exercise Details  

- Scenario packet includes a blank line list template, sample case narratives, and survey forms  
- Teams will merge passive reports and active survey data into one standardized file  
- Output must highlight records requiring follow-up or data completion
